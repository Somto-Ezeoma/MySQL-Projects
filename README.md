# MySQL-Projects
This SQL project was done using MySql and the database used for this project is AdventureWorks database. This serves as a demonstrative database, offering a practical and comprehensive example of an enterprise data model. It covers various business aspects, including sales, production, and human resources, making it an ideal playground for learning, exploration, and experimentation. Throughout the project, I demonstrated my SQL proficiency by executing a diverse set of queries. These tasks included sorting and filtering data, computing totals and averages, joining tables, and grouping data based on specific criteria. Notable functionalities covered in the queries including retrieving a sorted list of offices by country, state, and city; determining the total number of employees; calculating the sum of payments received; identifying product lines containing the term 'Cars'; and reporting total payments for a specific date.

Furthermore, the project involved querying for payments surpassing a specified threshold, listing products within each product line, determining the quantity of products in each line, finding the minimum payment received, and listing payments greater than twice the average payment. Additionally, the exploration extended to calculating the average percentage markup of the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) on the buy price, identifying distinct products sold by ClassicModels, retrieving customer information without assigned sales representatives, and identifying executives with titles containing "VP" or "Manager."

In conclusion, this SQL project highlights my competence in managing relational databases, employing SQL queries for the efficient extraction and manipulation of data. It underscores my abilities in data analysis, sorting, filtering, aggregation, and table joining, ultimately deriving significant insights from the database.
